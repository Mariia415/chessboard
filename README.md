# chessboard


## Training project where different approaches used to create same looking chessboard 
</br>
</br>

- Each html file contains different mark up, approach reflected in files' names e.g. `chessboard-div.html` means that mark up built on `<div>` elements
</br>

- One `css` file is used to style all three `html` files, FlexBox used for layout wherever possible (exception is chessboard built with `<table></table>`)
